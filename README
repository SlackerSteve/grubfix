This script makes reinstalling Grub (e.g. after installing Windows and 
it removed Grub from the MBR) easy.

The script is meant to be run from a Live CD. It will ask you to 
choose your Linux partition and the hard drive you want to install Grub 
to. If there is only one partition or drive, it will automatically 
select it for you (Asking for confirmation before installing Grub, of 
course). The script also backs up your MBR before installing, so you can 
restore it if something goes wrong.

This has only been tested with Grub2 and Linux Mint 8 Main edition, but 
I think it should work with Grub legacy and other distros.

This script requires dialog, and will automatically install it if not 
found.
